SOLVED:
- does not display sold out when product quantity is zero. The product's quantity stays at 1 and exception is never thrown
    Product.java    (kinda solved)
- item quantity stuck at 1 now and prints sold out even though there is 1 more of that item
- Added the printDispenseMessage method in the VendoMatic class but the console still isn't printing the desired result (Shaun)
- Vendomatic purchase() has a compile time exception when selecting invalid choices that don't exist in the map
- Vendomatic should reprompt the user to purchase() if they have an invalid finish transaction (Shaun)
